#Weekend Challenge 4
##To Do Application
- Front end experience allows a user to create a Task.
- Task is then stored inside of a database (SQL)
- When a Task is created the front end refreshes to show all tasks that need to be completed.
- Tasks are sorted showing tasks yet to complete first, and completed tasks last
- Each Task should has an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
- Deleting a task removes it from visual representation and the database.
- There is an alert that pops up when requesting to delete confirming that you want to delete

##Database Structure
- The database.sql text file in the repo that includes all of the CREATE TABLE queries to duplicate database.

### Styling is a mess

###THESE TWO ARE NOT YET FUNCTIONAL
    - When a Task is complete, the visual representation should change on the front end.
    - Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.
